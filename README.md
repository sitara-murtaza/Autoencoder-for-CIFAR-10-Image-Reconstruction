# Autoencoder-for-CIFAR-10-Image-Reconstruction
This code implements a basic autoencoder using PyTorch to reconstruct CIFAR-10 images. The encoder compresses images into a low-dimensional latent vector, and the decoder reconstructs the original image from this representation. The model is trained using mean squared error (MSE) loss to minimize reconstruction error.
